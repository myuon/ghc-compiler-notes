Note [Worker/wrapper transform on replicateM/replicateM_]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The implementations of replicateM and replicateM_ both leverage the
worker/wrapper transform. The simpler implementation of replicateM_, as an
example, would be:

    replicateM_ 0 _ = pure ()
    replicateM_ n f = f *> replicateM_ (n - 1) f

However, the self-recursive nature of this implementation inhibits inlining,
which means we never get to specialise to the action (`f` in the code above).
By contrast, the implementation below with a local loop makes it possible to
inline the entire definition (as happens for foldr, for example) thereby
specialising for the particular action.
