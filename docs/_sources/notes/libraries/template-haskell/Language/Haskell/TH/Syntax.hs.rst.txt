Note [Role of TExp]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TExp's argument must have a nominal role, not phantom as would
be inferred (#8459).  Consider

  e :: TExp Age
  e = MkAge 3

  foo = $(coerce e) + 4::Int

The splice will evaluate to (MkAge 3) and you can't add that to
4::Int. So you can't coerce a (TExp Age) to a (TExp Int). --------------------------------------------------

Note [Data for non-algebraic types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Class Data was originally intended for algebraic data types.  But
it is possible to use it for abstract types too.  For example, in
package `text` we find

  instance Data Text where
    ...
    toConstr _ = packConstr

  packConstr :: Constr
  packConstr = mkConstr textDataType "pack" [] Prefix

Here `packConstr` isn't a real data constructor, it's an ordinary
function.  Two complications

* In such a case, we must take care to build the Name using
  mkNameG_v (for values), not mkNameG_d (for data constructors).
  See #10796.

* The pseudo-constructor is named only by its string, here "pack".
  But 'dataToQa' needs the TyCon of its defining module, and has
  to assume it's defined in the same module as the TyCon itself.
  But nothing enforces that; #12596 shows what goes wrong if
  "pack" is defined in a different module than the data type "Text".

Note [GADT return type]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The return type of a GADT constructor does not necessarily match the name of
the data type:

type S = T

data T a where
    MkT :: S Int


type S a = T

data T a where
    MkT :: S Char Int


type Id a = a
type S a = T

data T a where
    MkT :: Id (S Char Int)


That is why we allow the return type stored by a constructor to be an
arbitrary type. See also #11341


Note [Representing concrete syntax in types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Haskell has a rich concrete syntax for types, including
  t1 -> t2, (t1,t2), [t], and so on
In TH we represent all of this using AppT, with a distinguished
type constructor at the head.  So,
  Type              TH representation
  -----------------------------------------------
  t1 -> t2          ArrowT `AppT` t2 `AppT` t2
  [t]               ListT `AppT` t
  (t1,t2)           TupleT 2 `AppT` t1 `AppT` t2
  '(t1,t2)          PromotedTupleT 2 `AppT` t1 `AppT` t2

But if the original HsSyn used prefix application, we won't use
these special TH constructors.  For example
  [] t              ConT "[]" `AppT` t
  (->) t            ConT "->" `AppT` t
In this way we can faithfully represent in TH whether the original
HsType used concrete syntax or not.

The one case that doesn't fit this pattern is that of promoted lists
  '[ Maybe, IO ]    PromotedListT 2 `AppT` t1 `AppT` t2
but it's very smelly because there really is no type constructor
corresponding to PromotedListT. So we encode HsExplicitListTy with
PromotedConsT and PromotedNilT (which *do* have underlying type
constructors):
  '[ Maybe, IO ]    PromotedConsT `AppT` Maybe `AppT`
                    (PromotedConsT  `AppT` IO `AppT` PromotedNilT)
