Note [Fingerprinting IfaceDecls]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The general idea here is that we first examine the 'IfaceDecl's and determine
the recursive groups of them. We then walk these groups in dependency order,
serializing each contained 'IfaceDecl' to a "Binary" buffer which we then
hash using MD5 to produce a fingerprint for the group.

However, the serialization that we use is a bit funny: we override the @putName@
operation with our own which serializes the hash of a 'Name' instead of the
'Name' itself. This ensures that the fingerprint of a decl changes if anything
in its transitive closure changes. This trick is why we must be careful about
traversing in dependency order: we need to ensure that we have hashes for
everything referenced by the decl which we are fingerprinting.

Moreover, we need to be careful to distinguish between serialization of binding
Names (e.g. the ifName field of a IfaceDecl) and non-binding (e.g. the ifInstCls
field of a IfaceClsInst): only in the non-binding case should we include the
fingerprint; in the binding case we shouldn't since it is merely the name of the
thing that we are currently fingerprinting.


Note [The ABI of an IfaceDecl]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ABI of a declaration consists of:

   (a) the full name of the identifier (inc. module and package,
       because these are used to construct the symbol name by which
       the identifier is known externally).

   (b) the declaration itself, as exposed to clients.  That is, the
       definition of an Id is included in the fingerprint only if
       it is made available as an unfolding in the interface.

   (c) the fixity of the identifier (if it exists)
   (d) for Ids: rules
   (e) for classes: instances, fixity & rules for methods
   (f) for datatypes: instances, fixity & rules for constrs

Items (c)-(f) are not stored in the IfaceDecl, but instead appear
elsewhere in the interface file.  But they are *fingerprinted* with
the declaration itself. This is done by grouping (c)-(f) in IfaceDeclExtras,
and fingerprinting that as part of the declaration.


Note [Original module]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this:
        module X where { data family T }
        module Y( T(..) ) where { import X; data instance T Int = MkT Int }
The exported Avail from Y will look like
        X.T{X.T, Y.MkT}
That is, in Y,
  - only MkT is brought into scope by the data instance;
  - but the parent (used for grouping and naming in T(..) exports) is X.T
  - and in this case we export X.T too

In the result of MkIfaceExports, the names are grouped by defining module,
so we may need to split up a single Avail into multiple ones.



Note [Internal used_names]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of the used_names are External Names, but we can have Internal
Names too: see Note [Binders in Template Haskell] in Convert, and
#5362 for an example.  Such Names are always
  - Such Names are always for locally-defined things, for which we
    don't gather usage info, so we can just ignore them in ent_map
  - They are always System Names, hence the assert, just as a double check.
