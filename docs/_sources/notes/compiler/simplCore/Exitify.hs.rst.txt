Note [Exitification]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module implements Exitification. The goal is to pull as much code out of
recursive functions as possible, as the simplifier is better at inlining into
call-sites that are not in recursive functions.

Example:

  let t = foo bar
  joinrec go 0     x y = t (x*x)
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …

We’d like to inline `t`, but that does not happen: Because t is a thunk and is
used in a recursive function, doing so might lose sharing in general. In
this case, however, `t` is on the _exit path_ of `go`, so called at most once.
How do we make this clearly visible to the simplifier?

A code path (i.e., an expression in a tail-recursive position) in a recursive
function is an exit path if it does not contain a recursive call. We can bind
this expression outside the recursive function, as a join-point.

Example result:

  let t = foo bar
  join exit x = t (x*x)
  joinrec go 0     x y = jump exit x
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …

Now `t` is no longer in a recursive function, and good things happen!


Note [Interesting expression]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We do not want this to happen:

  joinrec go 0     x y = x
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …
==>
  join exit x = x
  joinrec go 0     x y = jump exit x
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …

because the floated exit path (`x`) is simply a parameter of `go`; there are
not useful interactions exposed this way.

Neither do we want this to happen

  joinrec go 0     x y = x+x
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …
==>
  join exit x = x+x
  joinrec go 0     x y = jump exit x
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …

where the floated expression `x+x` is a bit more complicated, but still not
intersting.

Expressions are interesting when they move an occurrence of a variable outside
the recursive `go` that can benefit from being obviously called once, for example:
 * a local thunk that can then be inlined (see example in note [Exitification])
 * the parameter of a function, where the demand analyzer then can then
   see that it is called at most once, and hence improve the function’s
   strictness signature

So we only hoist an exit expression out if it mentiones at least one free,
non-imported variable.



Note [Jumps can be interesting]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A jump to a join point can be interesting, if its arguments contain free
non-exported variables (z in the following example):

  joinrec go 0     x y = jump j (x+z)
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …
==>
  join exit x y = jump j (x+z)
  joinrec go 0     x y = jump exit x
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)


The join point itself can be interesting, even if none if its
arguments have free variables free in the joinrec.  For example

  join j p = case p of (x,y) -> x+y
  joinrec go 0     x y = jump j (x,y)
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y) y
  in …

Here, `j` would not be inlined because we do not inline something that looks
like an exit join point (see Note [Do not inline exit join points]). But
if we exitify the 'jump j (x,y)' we get

  join j p = case p of (x,y) -> x+y
  join exit x y = jump j (x,y)
  joinrec go 0     x y = jump exit x y
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y) y
  in …

and now 'j' can inline, and we get rid of the pair. Here's another
example (assume `g` to be an imported function that, on its own,
does not make this interesting):

  join j y = map f y
  joinrec go 0     x y = jump j (map g x)
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …

Again, `j` would not be inlined because we do not inline something that looks
like an exit join point (see Note [Do not inline exit join points]).

But after exitification we have

  join j y = map f y
  join exit x = jump j (map g x)
  joinrec go 0     x y = jump j (map g x)
              go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …

and now we can inline `j` and this will allow `map/map` to fire.




Note [Idempotency]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We do not want this to happen, where we replace the floated expression with
essentially the same expression:

  join exit x = t (x*x)
  joinrec go 0     x y = jump exit x
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …
==>
  join exit x = t (x*x)
  join exit' x = jump exit x
  joinrec go 0     x y = jump exit' x
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …

So when the RHS is a join jump, and all of its arguments are captured variables,
then we leave it in place.

Note that `jump exit x` in this example looks interesting, as `exit` is a free
variable. Therefore, idempotency does not simply follow from floating only
interesting expressions.



Note [Calculating free variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have two options where to annotate the tree with free variables:

 A) The whole tree.
 B) Each individual joinrec as we come across it.

Downside of A: We pay the price on the whole module, even outside any joinrecs.
Downside of B: We pay the price per joinrec, possibly multiple times when
joinrecs are nested.

Further downside of A: If the exitify function returns annotated expressions,
it would have to ensure that the annotations are correct.

We therefore choose B, and calculate the free variables in `exitify`.




Note [Do not inline exit join points]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we have

  let t = foo bar
  join exit x = t (x*x)
  joinrec go 0     x y = jump exit x
          go (n-1) x y = jump go (n-1) (x+y)
  in …

we do not want the simplifier to simply inline `exit` back in (which it happily
would).

To prevent this, we need to recognize exit join points, and then disable
inlining.

Exit join points, recognizeable using `isExitJoinId` are join points with an
occurence in a recursive group, and can be recognized (after the occurence
analyzer ran!) using `isExitJoinId`.
This function detects joinpoints with `occ_in_lam (idOccinfo id) == True`,
because the lambdas of a non-recursive join point are not considered for
`occ_in_lam`.  For example, in the following code, `j1` is /not/ marked
occ_in_lam, because `j2` is called only once.

  join j1 x = x+1
  join j2 y = join j1 (y+2)

To prevent inlining, we check for isExitJoinId
* In `preInlineUnconditionally` directly.
* In `simplLetUnfolding` we simply give exit join points no unfolding, which
  prevents inlining in `postInlineUnconditionally` and call sites.



Note [Placement of the exitification pass]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I (Joachim) experimented with multiple positions for the Exitification pass in
the Core2Core pipeline:

 A) Before the `simpl_phases`
 B) Between the `simpl_phases` and the "main" simplifier pass
 C) After demand_analyser
 D) Before the final simplification phase

Here is the table (this is without inlining join exit points in the final
simplifier run):

Position A is disqualified, as it does not get rid of the allocations in
fannkuch-redux.
Position A and B are disqualified because it increases instructions in k-nucleotide.
Positions C and D have their advantages: C decreases allocations in simpl, but D instructions in fasta.

Assuming we have a budget of _one_ run of Exitification, then C wins (but we
could get more from running it multiple times, as seen in fish).



Note [Picking arguments to abstract over]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we create an exit join point, so we need to abstract over those of its
free variables that are be out-of-scope at the destination of the exit join
point. So we go through the list `captured` and pick those that are actually
free variables of the join point.

We do not just `filter (`elemVarSet` fvs) captured`, as there might be
shadowing, and `captured` may contain multiple variables with the same Unique. I
these cases we want to abstract only over the last occurence, hence the `foldr`
(with emphasis on the `r`). This is #15110.
