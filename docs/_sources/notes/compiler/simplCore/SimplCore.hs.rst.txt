Note [Inline in InitialPhase]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In GHC 8 and earlier we did not inline anything in the InitialPhase. But that is
confusing for users because when they say INLINE they expect the function to inline
right away.

So now we do inlining immediately, even in the InitialPhase, assuming that the
Id's Activation allows it.

This is a surprisingly big deal. Compiler performance improved a lot
when I made this change:

Note [RULEs enabled in SimplGently]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RULES are enabled when doing "gentle" simplification.  Two reasons:

  * We really want the class-op cancellation to happen:
        op (df d1 d2) --> $cop3 d1 d2
    because this breaks the mutual recursion between 'op' and 'df'

  * I wanted the RULE
        lift String ===> ...
    to work in Template Haskell when simplifying
    splices, so we get simpler code for literal strings

But watch out: list fusion can prevent floating.  So use phase control
to switch off those rules until after floating.



Note [Messing up the exported Id's RULES]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We must be careful about discarding (obviously) or even merging the
RULES on the exported Id. The example that went bad on me at one stage
was this one:

    iterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
        [Exported]
    iterate = iterateList

    iterateFB c f x = x `c` iterateFB c f (f x)
    iterateList f x =  x : iterateList f (f x)
        [Not exported]

    {-# RULES
    "iterate"   forall f x.     iterate f x = build (\c _n -> iterateFB c f x)
    "iterateFB"                 iterateFB (:) = iterateList
     #-}

This got shorted out to:

    iterateList :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
    iterateList = iterate

    iterateFB c f x = x `c` iterateFB c f (f x)
    iterate f x =  x : iterate f (f x)

    {-# RULES
    "iterate"   forall f x.     iterate f x = build (\c _n -> iterateFB c f x)
    "iterateFB"                 iterateFB (:) = iterate
     #-}

And now we get an infinite loop in the rule system
        iterate f x -> build (\cn -> iterateFB c f x)
                    -> iterateFB (:) f x
                    -> iterate f x

Old "solution":
        use rule switching-off pragmas to get rid
        of iterateList in the first place

But in principle the user *might* want rules that only apply to the Id
he says.  And inline pragmas are similar
   {-# NOINLINE f #-}
   f = local
   local = <stuff>
Then we do not want to get rid of the NOINLINE.

Hence hasShortableIdinfo.




Note [Rules and indirection-zapping]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Problem: what if x_exported has a RULE that mentions something in ...bindings...?
Then the things mentioned can be out of scope!  Solution
 a) Make sure that in this pass the usage-info from x_exported is
        available for ...bindings...
 b) If there are any such RULES, rec-ify the entire top-level.
    It'll get sorted out next time round

Other remarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If more than one exported thing is equal to a local thing (i.e., the
local thing really is shared), then we do one only:
\begin{verbatim}
        x_local = ....
        x_exported1 = x_local
        x_exported2 = x_local
==>
        x_exported1 = ....

        x_exported2 = x_exported1
\end{verbatim}

We rely on prior eta reduction to simplify things like
\begin{verbatim}
        x_exported = /\ tyvars -> x_local tyvars
==>
        x_exported = x_local
\end{verbatim}
Hence,there's a possibility of leaving unchanged something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
        x_local = ....
        x_exported1 = x_local Int
\end{verbatim}
By the time we've thrown away the types in STG land this
could be eliminated.  But I don't think it's very common
and it's dangerous to do this fiddling in STG land
because we might elminate a binding that's mentioned in the
unfolding for something.



Note [Indirection zapping and ticks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unfortunately this is another place where we need a special case for
ticks. The following happens quite regularly:

        x_local = <expression>
        x_exported = tick<x> x_local

Which we want to become:

        x_exported =  tick<x> <expression>

As it makes no sense to keep the tick and the expression on separate
bindings. Note however that that this might increase the ticks scoping
over the execution of x_local, so we can only do this for floatable
ticks. More often than not, other references will be unfoldings of
x_exported, and therefore carry the tick anyway.


Note [Transferring IdInfo]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we have
     lcl_id = e; exp_id = lcl_id

and lcl_id has useful IdInfo, we don't want to discard it by going
     gbl_id = e; lcl_id = gbl_id

Instead, transfer IdInfo from lcl_id to exp_id, specifically
* (Stable) unfolding
* Strictness
* Rules
* Inline pragma

Overwriting, rather than merging, seems to work ok.

We also zap the InlinePragma on the lcl_id. It might originally
have had a NOINLINE, which we have now transferred; and we really
want the lcl_id to inline now that its RHS is trivial!
