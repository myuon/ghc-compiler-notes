Note [accSqueeze]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BL 2007/09
Doing a nice fold over the UniqSet makes trivColorable use
32% of total compile time and 42% of total alloc when compiling SHA1.hs from darcs.
Therefore the UniqFM is made non-abstract and we use custom fold.

MS 2010/04
When converting UniqFM to use Data.IntMap, the fold cannot use UniqFM internal
representation any more. But it is imperative that the accSqueeze stops
the folding if the count gets greater or equal to maxCount. We thus convert
UniqFM to a (lazy) list, do the fold and stops if necessary, which was
the most efficient variant tried. Benchmark compiling 10-times SHA1.hs follows.
(original = previous implementation, folding = fold of the whole UFM,
 lazyFold = the current implementation,
 hackFold = using internal representation of Data.IntMap)
