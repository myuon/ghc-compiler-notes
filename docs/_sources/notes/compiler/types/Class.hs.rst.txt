Note [Associated type defaults]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following is an example of associated type defaults:
   class C a where
     data D a r

     type F x a b :: *
     type F p q r = (p,q)->r    -- Default

Note that

 * The TyCons for the associated types *share type variables* with the
   class, so that we can tell which argument positions should be
   instantiated in an instance decl.  (The first for 'D', the second
   for 'F'.)

 * We can have default definitions only for *type* families,
   not data families

 * In the default decl, the "patterns" should all be type variables,
   but (in the source language) they don't need to be the same as in
   the 'type' decl signature or the class.  It's more like a
   free-standing 'type instance' declaration.

 * HOWEVER, in the internal ClassATItem we rename the RHS to match the
   tyConTyVars of the family TyCon.  So in the example above we'd get
   a ClassATItem of
        ATI F ((x,a) -> b)
   So the tyConTyVars of the family TyCon bind the free vars of
   the default Type rhs

The @mkClass@ function fills in the indirect superclasses.

The SrcSpan is for the entire original declaration.


Note [Associated type tyvar names]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The TyCon of an associated type should use the same variable names as its
parent class. Thus
    class C a b where
      type F b x a :: *
We make F use the same Name for 'a' as C does, and similary 'b'.

The reason for this is when checking instances it's easier to match
them up, to ensure they match.  Eg
    instance C Int [d] where
      type F [d] x Int = ....
we should make sure that the first and third args match the instance
header.

Having the same variables for class and tycon is also used in checkValidRoles
(in TcTyClsDecls) when checking a class's roles.
