Note [Coverage condition]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example
      class C a b | a -> b
      instance theta => C t1 t2

For the coverage condition, we check
   (normal)    fv(t2) `subset` fv(t1)
   (liberal)   fv(t2) `subset` oclose(fv(t1), theta)

The liberal version  ensures the self-consistency of the instance, but
it does not guarantee termination. Example:

   class Mul a b c | a b -> c where
        (.*.) :: a -> b -> c

   instance Mul Int Int Int where (.*.) = (*)
   instance Mul Int Float Float where x .*. y = fromIntegral x * y
   instance Mul a b c => Mul a [b] [c] where x .*. v = map (x.*.) v

In the third instance, it's not the case that fv([c]) `subset` fv(a,[b]).
But it is the case that fv([c]) `subset` oclose( theta, fv(a,[b]) )

But it is a mistake to accept the instance because then this defn:
        f = \ b x y -> if b then x .*. [y] else y
makes instance inference go into a loop, because it requires the constraint
        Mul a [b] b


Note [Closing over kinds in coverage]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have a fundep  (a::k) -> b
Then if 'a' is instantiated to (x y), where x:k2->*, y:k2,
then fixing x really fixes k2 as well, and so k2 should be added to
the lhs tyvars in the fundep check.

Example (#8391), using liberal coverage
      data Foo a = ...  -- Foo :: forall k. k -> *
      class Bar a b | a -> b
      instance Bar a (Foo a)

    In the instance decl, (a:k) does fix (Foo k a), but only if we notice
    that (a:k) fixes k.  #10109 is another example.

Here is a more subtle example, from HList-0.4.0.0 (#10564)

  class HasFieldM (l :: k) r (v :: Maybe *)
        | l r -> v where ...
  class HasFieldM1 (b :: Maybe [*]) (l :: k) r v
        | b l r -> v where ...
  class HMemberM (e1 :: k) (l :: [k]) (r :: Maybe [k])
        | e1 l -> r

  data Label :: k -> *
  type family LabelsOf (a :: [*]) ::  *

  instance (HMemberM (Label {k} (l::k)) (LabelsOf xs) b,
            HasFieldM1 b l (r xs) v)
         => HasFieldM l (r xs) v where

Is the instance OK? Does {l,r,xs} determine v?  Well:

  * From the instance constraint HMemberM (Label k l) (LabelsOf xs) b,
    plus the fundep "| el l -> r" in class HMameberM,
    we get {l,k,xs} -> b

  * Note the 'k'!! We must call closeOverKinds on the seed set
    ls_tvs = {l,r,xs}, BEFORE doing oclose, else the {l,k,xs}->b
    fundep won't fire.  This was the reason for #10564.

  * So starting from seeds {l,r,xs,k} we do oclose to get
    first {l,r,xs,k,b}, via the HMemberM constraint, and then
    {l,r,xs,k,b,v}, via the HasFieldM1 constraint.

  * And that fixes v.

However, we must closeOverKinds whenever augmenting the seed set
in oclose!  Consider #10109:

  data Succ a   -- Succ :: forall k. k -> *
  class Add (a :: k1) (b :: k2) (ab :: k3) | a b -> ab
  instance (Add a b ab) => Add (Succ {k1} (a :: k1))
                               b
                               (Succ {k3} (ab :: k3})

We start with seed set {a:k1,b:k2} and closeOverKinds to {a,k1,b,k2}.
Now use the fundep to extend to {a,k1,b,k2,ab}.  But we need to
closeOverKinds *again* now to {a,k1,b,k2,ab,k3}, so that we fix all
the variables free in (Succ {k3} ab).

Bottom line:
  * closeOverKinds on initial seeds (done automatically
    by tyCoVarsOfTypes in checkInstCoverage)
  * and closeOverKinds whenever extending those seeds (in oclose)



Note [The liberal coverage condition]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(oclose preds tvs) closes the set of type variables tvs,
wrt functional dependencies in preds.  The result is a superset
of the argument set.  For example, if we have
        class C a b | a->b where ...
then
        oclose [C (x,y) z, C (x,p) q] {x,y} = {x,y,z}
because if we know x and y then that fixes z.

We also use equality predicates in the predicates; if we have an
assumption `t1 ~ t2`, then we use the fact that if we know `t1` we
also know `t2` and the other way.
  eg    oclose [C (x,y) z, a ~ x] {a,y} = {a,y,z,x}

oclose is used (only) when checking the coverage condition for
an instance declaration



Note [Equality superclasses]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have
  class (a ~ [b]) => C a b

Remember from Note [The equality types story] in TysPrim, that
  * (a ~~ b) is a superclass of (a ~ b)
  * (a ~# b) is a superclass of (a ~~ b)

So when oclose expands superclasses we'll get a (a ~# [b]) superclass.
But that's an EqPred not a ClassPred, and we jolly well do want to
account for the mutual functional dependencies implied by (t1 ~# t2).
Hence the EqPred handling in oclose.  See #10778.



Note [Care with type functions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider (#12803)
  class C x y | x -> y
  type family F a b
  type family G c d = r | r -> d

Now consider
  oclose (C (F a b) (G c d)) {a,b}

Knowing {a,b} fixes (F a b) regardless of the injectivity of F.
But knowing (G c d) fixes only {d}, because G is only injective
in its second parameter.

Hence the tyCoVarsOfTypes/injTyVarsOfTypes dance in tv_fds.
