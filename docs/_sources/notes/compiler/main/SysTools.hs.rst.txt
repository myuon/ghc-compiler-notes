Note [How GHC finds toolchain utilities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SysTools.initSysProgs figures out exactly where all the auxiliary programs
are, and initialises mutable variables to make it easy to call them.
To do this, it makes use of definitions in Config.hs, which is a Haskell
file containing variables whose value is figured out by the build system.

Config.hs contains two sorts of things

  cGCC,         The *names* of the programs
  cCPP            e.g.  cGCC = gcc
  cUNLIT                cCPP = gcc -E
  etc           They do *not* include paths


  cUNLIT_DIR   The *path* to the directory containing unlit, split etc
  cSPLIT_DIR   *relative* to the root of the build tree,
                   for use when running *in-place* in a build tree (only)


---------------------------------------------
NOTES for an ALTERNATIVE scheme (i.e *not* what is currently implemented):

Another hair-brained scheme for simplifying the current tool location
nightmare in GHC: Simon originally suggested using another
configuration file along the lines of GCC's specs file - which is fine
except that it means adding code to read yet another configuration
file.  What I didn't notice is that the current package.conf is
general enough to do this:

Package
    {name = "tools",    import_dirs = [],  source_dirs = [],
     library_dirs = [], hs_libraries = [], extra_libraries = [],
     include_dirs = [], c_includes = [],   package_deps = [],
     extra_ghc_opts = ["-pgmc/usr/bin/gcc","-pgml${topdir}/bin/unlit", ... etc.],
     extra_cc_opts = [], extra_ld_opts = []}

Which would have the advantage that we get to collect together in one
place the path-specific package stuff with the path-specific tool
stuff.
                End of NOTES

Note [-Bsymbolic assumptions by GHC]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GHC has a few assumptions about interaction of relocations in NCG and linker:

1. -Bsymbolic resolves internal references when the shared library is linked,
   which is important for performance.
2. When there is a reference to data in a shared library from the main program,
   the runtime linker relocates the data object into the main program using an
   R_*_COPY relocation.
3. If we used -Bsymbolic, then this results in multiple copies of the data
   object, because some references have already been resolved to point to the
   original instance. This is bad!

We work around [3.] for native compiled code by avoiding the generation of
R_*_COPY relocations.

Unregisterised compiler can't evade R_*_COPY relocations easily thus we disable
-Bsymbolic linking there.
