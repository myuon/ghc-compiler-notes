Note [Missing home modules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes user doesn't want GHC to pick up modules, not explicitly listed
in a command line. For example, cabal may want to enable this warning
when building a library, so that GHC warns user about modules, not listed
neither in `exposed-modules`, nor in `other-modules`.

Here "home module" means a module, that doesn't come from an other package.

For example, if GHC is invoked with modules "A" and "B" as targets,
but "A" imports some other module "C", then GHC will issue a warning
about module "C" not being listed in a command line.

The warning in enabled by `-Wmissing-home-modules`. See #13129


Note [-fno-code mode]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GHC offers the flag -fno-code for the purpose of parsing and typechecking a
program without generating object files. This is intended to be used by tooling
and IDEs to provide quick feedback on any parser or type errors as cheaply as
possible.

When GHC is invoked with -fno-code no object files or linked output will be
generated. As many errors and warnings as possible will be generated, as if
-fno-code had not been passed. The session DynFlags will have
hscTarget == HscNothing.

-fwrite-interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whether interface files are generated in -fno-code mode is controlled by the
-fwrite-interface flag. The -fwrite-interface flag is a no-op if -fno-code is
not also passed. Recompilation avoidance requires interface files, so passing
-fno-code without -fwrite-interface should be avoided. If -fno-code were
re-implemented today, -fwrite-interface would be discarded and it would be
considered always on; this behaviour is as it is for backwards compatibility.

================================================================
IN SUMMARY: ALWAYS PASS -fno-code AND -fwrite-interface TOGETHER
================================================================

Template Haskell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A module using template haskell may invoke an imported function from inside a
splice. This will cause the type-checker to attempt to execute that code, which
would fail if no object files had been generated. See #8025. To rectify this,
during the downsweep we patch the DynFlags in the ModSummary of any home module
that is imported by a module that uses template haskell, to generate object
code.

The flavour of generated object code is chosen by defaultObjectTarget for the
target platform. It would likely be faster to generate bytecode, but this is not
supported on all platforms(?Please Confirm?), and does not support the entirety
of GHC haskell. See #1257.

The object files (and interface files if -fwrite-interface is disabled) produced
for template haskell are written to temporary files.

Note that since template haskell can run arbitrary IO actions, -fno-code mode
is no more secure than running without it.

Potential TODOS:
~~~~~
* Remove -fwrite-interface and have interface files always written in -fno-code
  mode
* Both .o and .dyn_o files are generated for template haskell, but we only need
  .dyn_o. Fix it.
* In make mode, a message like
  Compiling A (A.hs, /tmp/ghc_123.o)
  is shown if downsweep enabled object code generation for A. Perhaps we should
  show "nothing" or "temporary object file" instead. Note that one
  can currently use -keep-tmp-files and inspect the generated file with the
  current behaviour.
* Offer a -no-codedir command line option, and write what were temporary
  object files there. This would speed up recompilation.
* Use existing object files (if they are up to date) instead of always
  generating temporary ones.


Note [Recompilation checking in -fno-code mode]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we are compiling with -fno-code -fwrite-interface, there won't
be any object code that we can compare against, nor should there
be: we're *just* generating interface files.  In this case, we
want to check if the interface file is new, in lieu of the object
file.  See also #9243.
