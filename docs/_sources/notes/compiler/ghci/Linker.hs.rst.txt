Note [Crash early load_dyn and locateLib]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a package is "normal" (exposes it's code from more than zero Haskell
modules, unlike e.g. that in ghcilink004) and is built "dyn" way, then
it has it's code compiled and linked into the DLL, which GHCi linker picks
when loading the package's code (see the big comment in the beginning of
`locateLib`).

When loading DLLs, GHCi linker simply calls the system's `dlopen` or
`LoadLibrary` APIs. This is quite different from the case when GHCi linker
loads an object file or static library. When loading an object file or static
library GHCi linker parses them and resolves all symbols "manually".
These object file or static library may reference some external symbols
defined in some external DLLs. And GHCi should know which these
external DLLs are.

But when GHCi loads a DLL, it's the *system* linker who manages all
the necessary dependencies, and it is able to load this DLL not having
any extra info. Thus we don't *have to* crash in this case even if we
are unable to load any supposed dependencies explicitly.

Suppose during GHCi session a client of the package wants to
`foreign import` a symbol which isn't exposed by the package DLL, but
is exposed by such an external (dependency) DLL.
If the DLL isn't *explicitly* loaded because `load_dyn` failed to do
this, then the client code eventually crashes because the GHCi linker
isn't able to locate this symbol (GHCi linker maintains a list of
explicitly loaded DLLs it looks into when trying to find a symbol).

This is why we still should try to load all the dependency DLLs
even though we know that the system linker loads them implicitly when
loading the package DLL.

Why we still keep the `crash_early` opportunity then not allowing such
a permissive behaviour for any DLLs? Well, we, perhaps, improve a user
experience in some cases slightly.

But if it happens there exist other corner cases where our current
usage of `crash_early` flag is overly restrictive, we may lift the
restriction very easily.
we have already searched the filesystem; the strings passed to load_dyn
can be passed directly to loadDLL.  They are either fully-qualified
("/usr/lib/libfoo.so"), or unqualified ("libfoo.so").  In the latter case,
loadDLL is going to search the system paths to find the library.


Note [Fork/Exec Windows]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
fork/exec is expensive on Windows, for each time we ask GCC for a library we
have to eat the cost of af least 3 of these: gcc -> real_gcc -> cc1.
So instead get a list of location that GCC would search and use findDirs
which hopefully is written in an optimized mannor to take advantage of
caching. At the very least we remove the overhead of the fork/exec and waits
which dominate a large percentage of startup time on Windows.
