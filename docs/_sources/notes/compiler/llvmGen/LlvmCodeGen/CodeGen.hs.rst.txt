Note [Literals and branch conditions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is important that whenever we generate branch conditions for
literals like '1', they are properly narrowed to an LLVM expression of
type 'i1' (for bools.) Otherwise, nobody is happy. So when we convert
a CmmExpr to an LLVM expression for a branch conditional, exprToVarOpt
must be certain to return a properly narrowed type. genLit is
responsible for this, in the case of literal integers.

Often, we won't see direct statements like:

    if(1) {
      ...
    } else {
      ...
    }

at this point in the pipeline, because the Glorious Code Generator
will do trivial branch elimination in the sinking pass (among others,)
which will eliminate the expression entirely.

However, it's certainly possible and reasonable for this to occur in
hand-written C-- code. Consider something like:

    #if !defined(SOME_CONDITIONAL)
    #define CHECK_THING(x) 1
    #else
    #define CHECK_THING(x) some_operation((x))
    #endif

    f() {

      if (CHECK_THING(xyz)) {
        ...
      } else {
        ...
      }

    }

In such an instance, CHECK_THING might result in an *expression* in
one case, and a *literal* in the other, depending on what in
particular was #define'd. So we must be sure to properly narrow the
literal in this case to i1 as it won't be eliminated beforehand.

For a real example of this, see ./rts/StgStdThunks.cmm
