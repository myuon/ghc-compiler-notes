Note [depAnal determinism]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
depAnal is deterministic provided it gets the nodes in a deterministic order.
The order of lists that get_defs and get_uses return doesn't matter, as these
are only used to construct the edges, and stronglyConnCompFromEdgedVertices is
deterministic even when the edges are not in deterministic order as explained
in Note [Deterministic SCC] in Digraph.
