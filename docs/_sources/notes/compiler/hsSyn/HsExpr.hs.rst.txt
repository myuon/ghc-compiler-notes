Note [CmdSyntaxtable]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Used only for arrow-syntax stuff (HsCmdTop), the CmdSyntaxTable keeps
track of the methods needed for a Cmd.

* Before the renamer, this list is an empty list

* After the renamer, it takes the form @[(std_name, HsVar actual_name)]@
  For example, for the 'arr' method
   * normal case:            (GHC.Control.Arrow.arr, HsVar GHC.Control.Arrow.arr)
   * with rebindable syntax: (GHC.Control.Arrow.arr, arr_22)
             where @arr_22@ is whatever 'arr' is in scope

* After the type checker, it takes the form [(std_name, <expression>)]
  where <expression> is the evidence for the method.  This evidence is
  instantiated with the class, but is still polymorphic in everything
  else.  For example, in the case of 'arr', the evidence has type
         forall b c. (b->c) -> a b c
  where 'a' is the ambient type of the arrow.  This polymorphism is
  important because the desugarer uses the same evidence at multiple
  different types.

This is Less Cool than what we normally do for rebindable syntax, which is to
make fully-instantiated piece of evidence at every use site.  The Cmd way
is Less Cool because
  * The renamer has to predict which methods are needed.
    See the tedious RnExpr.methodNamesCmd.

  * The desugarer has to know the polymorphic type of the instantiated
    method. This is checked by Inst.tcSyntaxName, but is less flexible
    than the rest of rebindable syntax, where the type is less
    pre-ordained.  (And this flexibility is useful; for example we can
    typecheck do-notation with (>>=) :: m1 a -> (a -> m2 b) -> m2 b.)


Note [OutOfScope and GlobalRdrEnv]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To understand why we bundle a GlobalRdrEnv with an out-of-scope variable,
consider the following module:

    module A where

    foo :: ()
    foo = bar

    bat :: [Double]
    bat = [1.2, 3.4]

    $(return [])

    bar = ()
    bad = False

When A is compiled, the renamer determines that `bar` is not in scope in the
declaration of `foo` (since `bar` is declared in the following inter-splice
group).  Once it has finished typechecking the entire module, the typechecker
then generates the associated error message, which specifies both the type of
`bar` and a list of possible in-scope alternatives:

    A.hs:6:7: error:
        • Variable not in scope: bar :: ()
        • ‘bar’ (line 13) is not in scope before the splice on line 11
          Perhaps you meant ‘bat’ (line 9)

When it calls RnEnv.unknownNameSuggestions to identify these alternatives, the
typechecker must provide a GlobalRdrEnv.  If it provided the current one, which
contains top-level declarations for the entire module, the error message would
incorrectly suggest the out-of-scope `bar` and `bad` as possible alternatives
for `bar` (see #11680).  Instead, the typechecker must use the same
GlobalRdrEnv the renamer used when it determined that `bar` is out-of-scope.

To obtain this GlobalRdrEnv, can the typechecker simply use the out-of-scope
`bar`'s location to either reconstruct it (from the current GlobalRdrEnv) or to
look it up in some global store?  Unfortunately, no.  The problem is that
location information is not always sufficient for this task.  This is most
apparent when dealing with the TH function addTopDecls, which adds its
declarations to the FOLLOWING inter-splice group.  Consider these declarations:

    ex9 = cat               -- cat is NOT in scope here

    $(do -------------------------------------------------------------
        ds <- [d| f = cab   -- cat and cap are both in scope here
                  cat = ()
                |]
        addTopDecls ds
        [d| g = cab         -- only cap is in scope here
            cap = True
          |])

    ex10 = cat              -- cat is NOT in scope here

    $(return []) -----------------------------------------------------

    ex11 = cat              -- cat is in scope

Here, both occurrences of `cab` are out-of-scope, and so the typechecker needs
the GlobalRdrEnvs which were used when they were renamed.  These GlobalRdrEnvs
are different (`cat` is present only in the GlobalRdrEnv for f's `cab'), but the
locations of the two `cab`s are the same (they are both created in the same
splice).  Thus, we must include some additional information with each `cab` to
allow the typechecker to obtain the correct GlobalRdrEnv.  Clearly, the simplest
information to use is the GlobalRdrEnv itself.


Note [Parens in HsSyn]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HsPar (and ParPat in patterns, HsParTy in types) is used as follows

  * HsPar is required; the pretty printer does not add parens.

  * HsPars are respected when rearranging operator fixities.
    So   a * (b + c)  means what it says (where the parens are an HsPar)

  * For ParPat and HsParTy the pretty printer does add parens but this should be
    a no-op for ParsedSource, based on the pretty printer round trip feature
    introduced in
    https://phabricator.haskell.org/rGHC499e43824bda967546ebf95ee33ec1f84a114a7c

  * ParPat and HsParTy are pretty printed as '( .. )' regardless of whether or
    not they are strictly necessary. This should be addressed when #13238 is
    completed, to be treated the same as HsPar.




Note [Sections in HsSyn]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sections should always appear wrapped in an HsPar, thus
         HsPar (SectionR ...)
The parser parses sections in a wider variety of situations
(See Note [Parsing sections]), but the renamer checks for those
parens.  This invariant makes pretty-printing easier; we don't need
a special case for adding the parens round sections.



Note [Rebindable if]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The rebindable syntax for 'if' is a bit special, because when
rebindable syntax is *off* we do not want to treat
   (if c then t else e)
as if it was an application (ifThenElse c t e).  Why not?
Because we allow an 'if' to return *unboxed* results, thus
  if blah then 3# else 4#
whereas that would not be possible using a all to a polymorphic function
(because you can't call a polymorphic function at an unboxed type).

So we use Nothing to mean "use the old built-in typing rule".



Note [Record Update HsWrapper]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a wrapper in RecordUpd which is used for the *required*
constraints for pattern synonyms. This wrapper is created in the
typechecking and is then directly used in the desugaring without
modification.

For example, if we have the record pattern synonym P,
  pattern P :: (Show a) => a -> Maybe a
  pattern P{x} = Just x

  foo = (Just True) { x = False }
then `foo` desugars to something like
  foo = case Just True of
          P x -> P False
hence we need to provide the correct dictionaries to P's matcher on
the RHS so that we can build the expression.



Note [Located RdrNames]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A number of syntax elements have seemingly redundant locations attached to them.
This is deliberate, to allow transformations making use of the API Annotations
to easily correlate a Located Name in the RenamedSource with a Located RdrName
in the ParsedSource.

There are unfortunately enough differences between the ParsedSource and the
RenamedSource that the API Annotations cannot be used directly with
RenamedSource, so this allows a simple mapping to be used based on the location.


Note [m_ctxt in Match]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Match can occur in a number of contexts, such as a FunBind, HsCase, HsLam and
so on.

In order to simplify tooling processing and pretty print output, the provenance
is captured in an HsMatchContext.

This is particularly important for the API Annotations for a multi-equation
FunBind.

The parser initially creates a FunBind with a single Match in it for
every function definition it sees.

These are then grouped together by getMonoBind into a single FunBind,
where all the Matches are combined.

In the process, all the original FunBind fun_id's bar one are
discarded, including the locations.

This causes a problem for source to source conversions via API
Annotations, so the original fun_ids and infix flags are preserved in
the Match, when it originates from a FunBind.

Example infix function definition requiring individual API Annotations

    (&&&  ) [] [] =  []
    xs    &&&   [] =  xs
    (  &&&  ) [] ys =  ys





Note [The type of bind in Stmts]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some Stmts, notably BindStmt, keep the (>>=) bind operator.
We do NOT assume that it has type
    (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
In some cases (see #303, #1537) it might have a more
exotic type, such as
    (>>=) :: m i j a -> (a -> m j k b) -> m i k b
So we must be careful not to make assumptions about the type.
In particular, the monad may not be uniform throughout.



Note [TransStmt binder map]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The [(idR,idR)] in a TransStmt behaves as follows:

  * Before renaming: []

  * After renaming:
          [ (x27,x27), ..., (z35,z35) ]
    These are the variables
       bound by the stmts to the left of the 'group'
       and used either in the 'by' clause,
                or     in the stmts following the 'group'
    Each item is a pair of identical variables.

  * After typechecking:
          [ (x27:Int, x27:[Int]), ..., (z35:Bool, z35:[Bool]) ]
    Each pair has the same unique, but different *types*.



Note [BodyStmt]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BodyStmts are a bit tricky, because what they mean
depends on the context.  Consider the following contexts:

        A do expression of type (m res_ty)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        * BodyStmt E any_ty:   do { ....; E; ... }
                E :: m any_ty
          Translation: E >> ...

        A list comprehensions of type [elt_ty]
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        * BodyStmt E Bool:   [ .. | .... E ]
                        [ .. | ..., E, ... ]
                        [ .. | .... | ..., E | ... ]
                E :: Bool
          Translation: if E then fail else ...

        A guard list, guarding a RHS of type rhs_ty
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        * BodyStmt E BooParStmtBlockl:   f x | ..., E, ... = ...rhs...
                E :: Bool
          Translation: if E then fail else ...

        A monad comprehension of type (m res_ty)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        * BodyStmt E Bool:   [ .. | .... E ]
                E :: Bool
          Translation: guard E >> ...

Array comprehensions are handled like list comprehensions.



Note [How RecStmt works]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example:
   HsDo [ BindStmt x ex

        , RecStmt { recS_rec_ids   = [a, c]
                  , recS_stmts     = [ BindStmt b (return (a,c))
                                     , LetStmt a = ...b...
                                     , BindStmt c ec ]
                  , recS_later_ids = [a, b]

        , return (a b) ]

Here, the RecStmt binds a,b,c; but
  - Only a,b are used in the stmts *following* the RecStmt,
  - Only a,c are used in the stmts *inside* the RecStmt
        *before* their bindings

Why do we need *both* rec_ids and later_ids?  For monads they could be
combined into a single set of variables, but not for arrows.  That
follows from the types of the respective feedback operators:

        mfix :: MonadFix m => (a -> m a) -> m a
        loop :: ArrowLoop a => a (b,d) (c,d) -> a b c

* For mfix, the 'a' covers the union of the later_ids and the rec_ids
* For 'loop', 'c' is the later_ids and 'd' is the rec_ids



Note [Typing a RecStmt]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A (RecStmt stmts) types as if you had written

  (v1,..,vn, _, ..., _) <- mfix (\~(_, ..., _, r1, ..., rm) ->
                                 do { stmts
                                    ; return (v1,..vn, r1, ..., rm) })

where v1..vn are the later_ids
      r1..rm are the rec_ids



Note [Monad Comprehensions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Monad comprehensions require separate functions like 'return' and
'>>=' for desugaring. These functions are stored in the statements
used in monad comprehensions. For example, the 'return' of the 'LastStmt'
expression is used to lift the body of the monad comprehension:

  [ body | stmts ]
   =>
  stmts >>= \bndrs -> return body

In transform and grouping statements ('then ..' and 'then group ..') the
'return' function is required for nested monad comprehensions, for example:

  [ body | stmts, then f, rest ]
   =>
  f [ env | stmts ] >>= \bndrs -> [ body | rest ]

BodyStmts require the 'Control.Monad.guard' function for boolean
expressions:

  [ body | exp, stmts ]
   =>
  guard exp >> [ body | stmts ]

Parallel statements require the 'Control.Monad.Zip.mzip' function:

  [ body | stmts1 | stmts2 | .. ]
   =>
  mzip stmts1 (mzip stmts2 (..)) >>= \(bndrs1, (bndrs2, ..)) -> return body

In any other context than 'MonadComp', the fields for most of these
'SyntaxExpr's stay bottom.


Note [Applicative BodyStmt]

(#12143) For the purposes of ApplicativeDo, we treat any BodyStmt
as if it was a BindStmt with a wildcard pattern.  For example,

  do
    x <- A
    B
    return x

is transformed as if it were

  do
    x <- A
    _ <- B
    return x

so it transforms to

  (\(x,_) -> x) <$> A <*> B

But we have to remember when we treat a BodyStmt like a BindStmt,
because in error messages we want to emit the original syntax the user
wrote, not our internal representation.  So ApplicativeArgOne has a
Bool flag that is True when the original statement was a BodyStmt, so
that we can pretty-print it correctly.


Note [Pending Splices]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we rename an untyped bracket, we name and lift out all the nested
splices, so that when the typechecker hits the bracket, it can
typecheck those nested splices without having to walk over the untyped
bracket code.  So for example
    [| f $(g x) |]
looks like

    HsBracket (HsApp (HsVar "f") (HsSpliceE _ (g x)))

which the renamer rewrites to

    HsRnBracketOut (HsApp (HsVar f) (HsSpliceE sn (g x)))
                   [PendingRnSplice UntypedExpSplice sn (g x)]

* The 'sn' is the Name of the splice point, the SplicePointName

* The PendingRnExpSplice gives the splice that splice-point name maps to;
  and the typechecker can now conveniently find these sub-expressions

* The other copy of the splice, in the second argument of HsSpliceE
                                in the renamed first arg of HsRnBracketOut
  is used only for pretty printing

There are four varieties of pending splices generated by the renamer,
distinguished by their UntypedSpliceFlavour

 * Pending expression splices (UntypedExpSplice), e.g.,
       [|$(f x) + 2|]

   UntypedExpSplice is also used for
     * quasi-quotes, where the pending expression expands to
          $(quoter "...blah...")
       (see RnSplice.makePending, HsQuasiQuote case)

     * cross-stage lifting, where the pending expression expands to
          $(lift x)
       (see RnSplice.checkCrossStageLifting)

 * Pending pattern splices (UntypedPatSplice), e.g.,
       [| \$(f x) -> x |]

 * Pending type splices (UntypedTypeSplice), e.g.,
       [| f :: $(g x) |]

 * Pending declaration (UntypedDeclSplice), e.g.,
       [| let $(f x) in ... |]

There is a fifth variety of pending splice, which is generated by the type
checker:

  * Pending *typed* expression splices, (PendingTcSplice), e.g.,
        [||1 + $$(f 2)||]

It would be possible to eliminate HsRnBracketOut and use HsBracketOut for the
output of the renamer. However, when pretty printing the output of the renamer,
e.g., in a type error message, we *do not* want to print out the pending
splices. In contrast, when pretty printing the output of the type checker, we
*do* want to print the pending splices. So splitting them up seems to make
sense, although I hate to add another constructor to HsExpr.
