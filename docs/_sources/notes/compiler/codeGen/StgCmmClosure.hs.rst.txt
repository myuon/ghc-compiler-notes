Note [Data constructor dynamic tags]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The family size of a data type (the number of constructors
or the arity of a function) can be either:
   * small, if the family size < 2**tag_bits
   * big, otherwise.

Small families can have the constructor tag in the tag bits.
Big families only use the tag value 1 to represent evaluatedness.
We don't have very many tag bits: for example, we have 2 bits on
x86-32 and 3 bits on x86-64.


Note [GC recovery]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we a have a local let-binding (function or thunk)
   let f = <body> in ...
AND <body> allocates, then the heap-overflow check needs to know how
to re-start the evaluation.  It uses the "self" pointer to do this.
So even if there are no free variables in <body>, we still make
nodeMustPointToIt be True for non-top-level bindings.

Why do any such bindings exist?  After all, let-floating should have
floated them out.  Well, a clever optimiser might leave one there to
avoid a space leak, deliberately recomputing a thunk.  Also (and this
really does happen occasionally) let-floating may make a function f smaller
so it can be inlined, so now (f True) may generate a local no-fv closure.
This actually happened during bootstrapping GHC itself, with f=mkRdrFunBind
in TcGenDeriv.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The entry conventions depend on the type of closure being entered,
whether or not it has free variables, and whether we're running
sequentially or in parallel.

When black-holing, single-entry closures could also be entered via node
(rather than directly) to catch double-entry. 

Note [Black-holing non-updatable thunks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We must not black-hole non-updatable (single-entry) thunks otherwise
we run into issues like #10414. Specifically:

  * There is no reason to black-hole a non-updatable thunk: it should
    not be competed for by multiple threads

  * It could, conceivably, cause a space leak if we don't black-hole
    it, if there was a live but never-followed pointer pointing to it.
    Let's hope that doesn't happen.

  * It is dangerous to black-hole a non-updatable thunk because
     - is not updated (of course)
     - hence, if it is black-holed and another thread tries to evaluate
       it, that thread will block forever
    This actually happened in #10414.  So we do not black-hole
    non-updatable thunks.

  * How could two threads evaluate the same non-updatable (single-entry)
    thunk?  See Reid Barton's example below.

  * Only eager blackholing could possibly black-hole a non-updatable
    thunk, because lazy black-holing only affects thunks with an
    update frame on the stack.

Here is and example due to Reid Barton (#10414):
    x = \u []  concat [[1], []]
with the following definitions,

    concat x = case x of
        []       -> []
        (:) x xs -> (++) x (concat xs)

    (++) xs ys = case xs of
        []         -> ys
        (:) x rest -> (:) x ((++) rest ys)

Where we use the syntax @\u []@ to denote an updatable thunk and @\s []@ to
denote a single-entry (i.e. non-updatable) thunk. After a thread evaluates @x@
to WHNF and calls @(++)@ the heap will contain the following thunks,

    x = 1 : y
    y = \u []  (++) [] z
    z = \s []  concat []

Now that the stage is set, consider the follow evaluations by two racing threads
A and B,

  1. Both threads enter @y@ before either is able to replace it with an
     indirection

  2. Thread A does the case analysis in @(++)@ and consequently enters @z@,
     replacing it with a black-hole

  3. At some later point thread B does the same case analysis and also attempts
     to enter @z@. However, it finds that it has been replaced with a black-hole
     so it blocks.

  4. Thread A eventually finishes evaluating @z@ (to @[]@) and updates @y@
     accordingly. It does *not* update @z@, however, as it is single-entry. This
     leaves Thread B blocked forever on a black-hole which will never be
     updated.

To avoid this sort of condition we never black-hole non-updatable thunks.
