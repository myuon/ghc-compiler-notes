Note [exprArity invariant]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
exprArity has the following invariant:

  (1) If typeArity (exprType e) = n,
      then manifestArity (etaExpand e n) = n

      That is, etaExpand can always expand as much as typeArity says
      So the case analysis in etaExpand and in typeArity must match

  (2) exprArity e <= typeArity (exprType e)

  (3) Hence if (exprArity e) = n, then manifestArity (etaExpand e n) = n

      That is, if exprArity says "the arity is n" then etaExpand really
      can get "n" manifest lambdas to the top.

Why is this important?  Because
  - In TidyPgm we use exprArity to fix the *final arity* of
    each top-level Id, and in
  - In CorePrep we use etaExpand on each rhs, so that the visible lambdas
    actually match that arity, which in turn means
    that the StgRhs has the right number of lambdas

An alternative would be to do the eta-expansion in TidyPgm, at least
for top-level bindings, in which case we would not need the trim_arity
in exprArity.  That is a less local change, so I'm going to leave it for today!



Note [Newtype classes and eta expansion]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    NB: this nasty special case is no longer required, because
    for newtype classes we don't use the class-op rule mechanism
    at all.  See Note [Single-method classes] in TcInstDcls. SLPJ May 2013

-------- Old out of date comments, just for interest -----------
We have to be careful when eta-expanding through newtypes.  In general
it's a good idea, but annoyingly it interacts badly with the class-op
rule mechanism.  Consider

   class C a where { op :: a -> a }
   instance C b => C [b] where
     op x = ...

These translate to

   co :: forall a. (a->a) ~ C a

   $copList :: C b -> [b] -> [b]
   $copList d x = ...

   $dfList :: C b -> C [b]
   {-# DFunUnfolding = [$copList] #-}
   $dfList d = $copList d |> co@[b]

Now suppose we have:

   dCInt :: C Int

   blah :: [Int] -> [Int]
   blah = op ($dfList dCInt)

Now we want the built-in op/$dfList rule will fire to give
   blah = $copList dCInt

But with eta-expansion 'blah' might (and in #3772, which is
slightly more complicated, does) turn into

   blah = op (\eta. ($dfList dCInt |> sym co) eta)

and now it is *much* harder for the op/$dfList rule to fire, because
exprIsConApp_maybe won't hold of the argument to op.  I considered
trying to *make* it hold, but it's tricky and I gave up.

The test simplCore/should_compile/T3722 is an excellent example.
-------- End of old out of date comments, just for interest -----------




Note [exprArity for applications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we come to an application we check that the arg is trivial.
   eg  f (fac x) does not have arity 2,
                 even if f has arity 3!

* We require that is trivial rather merely cheap.  Suppose f has arity 2.
  Then    f (Just y)
  has arity 0, because if we gave it arity 1 and then inlined f we'd get
          let v = Just y in \w. <f-body>
  which has arity 0.  And we try to maintain the invariant that we don't
  have arity decreases.

*  The `max 0` is important!  (\x y -> f x) has arity 2, even if f is
   unknown, hence arity 0




Note [Definition of arity]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The "arity" of an expression 'e' is n if
   applying 'e' to *fewer* than n *value* arguments
   converges rapidly

Or, to put it another way

   there is no work lost in duplicating the partial
   application (e x1 .. x(n-1))

In the divegent case, no work is lost by duplicating because if the thing
is evaluated once, that's the end of the program.

Or, to put it another way, in any context C

   C[ (\x1 .. xn. e x1 .. xn) ]
         is as efficient as
   C[ e ]

It's all a bit more subtle than it looks:



Note [One-shot lambdas]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider one-shot lambdas
                let x = expensive in \y z -> E
We want this to have arity 1 if the \y-abstraction is a 1-shot lambda.



Note [Dealing with bottom]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Big Deal with computing arities is expressions like

   f = \x -> case x of
               True  -> \s -> e1
               False -> \s -> e2

This happens all the time when f :: Bool -> IO ()
In this case we do eta-expand, in order to get that \s to the
top, and give f arity 2.

This isn't really right in the presence of seq.  Consider
        (f bot) `seq` 1

This should diverge!  But if we eta-expand, it won't.  We ignore this
"problem" (unless -fpedantic-bottoms is on), because being scrupulous
would lose an important transformation for many programs. (See
#5587 for an example.)

Consider also
        f = \x -> error "foo"
Here, arity 1 is fine.  But if it is
        f = \x -> case x of
                        True  -> error "foo"
                        False -> \y -> x+y
then we want to get arity 2.  Technically, this isn't quite right, because
        (f True) `seq` 1
should diverge, but it'll converge if we eta-expand f.  Nevertheless, we
do so; it improves some programs significantly, and increasing convergence
isn't a bad thing.  Hence the ABot/ATop in ArityType.

So these two transformations aren't always the Right Thing, and we
have several tickets reporting unexpected behaviour resulting from
this transformation.  So we try to limit it as much as possible:

 (1) Do NOT move a lambda outside a known-bottom case expression
       case undefined of { (a,b) -> \y -> e }
     This showed up in #5557

 (2) Do NOT move a lambda outside a case if all the branches of
     the case are known to return bottom.
        case x of { (a,b) -> \y -> error "urk" }
     This case is less important, but the idea is that if the fn is
     going to diverge eventually anyway then getting the best arity
     isn't an issue, so we might as well play safe

 (3) Do NOT move a lambda outside a case unless
     (a) The scrutinee is ok-for-speculation, or
     (b) more liberally: the scrutinee is cheap (e.g. a variable), and
         -fpedantic-bottoms is not enforced (see #2915 for an example)

Of course both (1) and (2) are readily defeated by disguising the bottoms.

4. Note [Newtype arity]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Non-recursive newtypes are transparent, and should not get in the way.
We do (currently) eta-expand recursive newtypes too.  So if we have, say

        newtype T = MkT ([T] -> Int)

Suppose we have
        e = coerce T f
where f has arity 1.  Then: etaExpandArity e = 1;
that is, etaExpandArity looks through the coerce.

When we eta-expand e to arity 1: eta_expand 1 e T
we want to get:                  coerce T (\x::[T] -> (coerce ([T]->Int) e) x)

  HOWEVER, note that if you use coerce bogusly you can ge
        coerce Int negate
  And since negate has arity 2, you might try to eta expand.  But you can't
  decopose Int to a function type.   Hence the final case in eta_expand.



Note [The state-transformer hack]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have
        f = e
where e has arity n.  Then, if we know from the context that f has
a usage type like
        t1 -> ... -> tn -1-> t(n+1) -1-> ... -1-> tm -> ...
then we can expand the arity to m.  This usage type says that
any application (x e1 .. en) will be applied to uniquely to (m-n) more args
Consider f = \x. let y = <expensive>
                 in case x of
                      True  -> foo
                      False -> \(s:RealWorld) -> e
where foo has arity 1.  Then we want the state hack to
apply to foo too, so we can eta expand the case.

Then we expect that if f is applied to one arg, it'll be applied to two
(that's the hack -- we don't really know, and sometimes it's false)
See also Id.isOneShotBndr.



Note [State hack and bottoming functions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's a terrible idea to use the state hack on a bottoming function.
Here's what happens (#2861):

  f :: String -> IO T
  f = \p. error "..."

Eta-expand, using the state hack:

  f = \p. (\s. ((error "...") |> g1) s) |> g2
  g1 :: IO T ~ (S -> (S,T))
  g2 :: (S -> (S,T)) ~ IO T

Extrude the g2

  f' = \p. \s. ((error "...") |> g1) s
  f = f' |> (String -> g2)

Discard args for bottomming function

  f' = \p. \s. ((error "...") |> g1 |> g3
  g3 :: (S -> (S,T)) ~ (S,T)

Extrude g1.g3

  f'' = \p. \s. (error "...")
  f' = f'' |> (String -> S -> g1.g3)

And now we can repeat the whole loop.  Aargh!  The bug is in applying the
state hack to a function which then swallows the argument.

This arose in another guise in #3959.  Here we had

     catch# (throw exn >> return ())

Note that (throw :: forall a e. Exn e => e -> a) is called with [a = IO ()].
After inlining (>>) we get

     catch# (\_. throw {IO ()} exn)

We must *not* eta-expand to

     catch# (\_ _. throw {...} exn)

because 'catch#' expects to get a (# _,_ #) after applying its argument to
a State#, not another function!

In short, we use the state hack to allow us to push let inside a lambda,
but not to introduce a new lambda.




Note [ArityType]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ArityType is the result of a compositional analysis on expressions,
from which we can decide the real arity of the expression (extracted
with function exprEtaExpandArity).

Here is what the fields mean. If an arbitrary expression 'f' has
ArityType 'at', then

 * If at = ABot n, then (f x1..xn) definitely diverges. Partial
   applications to fewer than n args may *or may not* diverge.

   We allow ourselves to eta-expand bottoming functions, even
   if doing so may lose some `seq` sharing,
       let x = <expensive> in \y. error (g x y)
       ==> \y. let x = <expensive> in error (g x y)

 * If at = ATop as, and n=length as,
   then expanding 'f' to (\x1..xn. f x1 .. xn) loses no sharing,
   assuming the calls of f respect the one-shot-ness of
   its definition.

   NB 'f' is an arbitrary expression, eg (f = g e1 e2).  This 'f'
   can have ArityType as ATop, with length as > 0, only if e1 e2 are
   themselves.

 * In both cases, f, (f x1), ... (f x1 ... f(n-1)) are definitely
   really functions, or bottom, but *not* casts from a data type, in
   at least one case branch.  (If it's a function in one case branch but
   an unsafe cast from a data type in another, the program is bogus.)
   So eta expansion is dynamically ok; see Note [State hack and
   bottoming functions], the part about catch#

Example:
      f = \x\y. let v = <expensive> in
          \s(one-shot) \t(one-shot). blah
      'f' has ArityType [ManyShot,ManyShot,OneShot,OneShot]
      The one-shot-ness means we can, in effect, push that
      'let' inside the \st.


Suppose f = \xy. x+y
Then  f             :: AT [False,False] ATop
      f v           :: AT [False]       ATop
      f <expensive> :: AT []            ATop

-------------------- Main arity code ----------------------------
See Note [ArityType]


Note [Arity analysis]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The motivating example for arity analysis is this:

  f = \x. let g = f (x+1)
          in \y. ...g...

What arity does f have?  Really it should have arity 2, but a naive
look at the RHS won't see that.  You need a fixpoint analysis which
says it has arity "infinity" the first time round.

This example happens a lot; it first showed up in Andy Gill's thesis,
fifteen years ago!  It also shows up in the code for 'rnf' on lists
in #4138.

The analysis is easy to achieve because exprEtaExpandArity takes an
argument
     type CheapFun = CoreExpr -> Maybe Type -> Bool
used to decide if an expression is cheap enough to push inside a
lambda.  And exprIsCheapX in turn takes an argument
     type CheapAppFun = Id -> Int -> Bool
which tells when an application is cheap. This makes it easy to
write the analysis loop.

The analysis is cheap-and-cheerful because it doesn't deal with
mutual recursion.  But the self-recursive case is the important one.




Note [Eta expanding through dictionaries]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the experimental -fdicts-cheap flag is on, we eta-expand through
dictionary bindings.  This improves arities. Thereby, it also
means that full laziness is less prone to floating out the
application of a function to its dictionary arguments, which
can thereby lose opportunities for fusion.  Example:
        foo :: Ord a => a -> ...
     foo = /\a \(d:Ord a). let d' = ...d... in \(x:a). ....
        -- So foo has arity 1

     f = \x. foo dInt $ bar x

The (foo DInt) is floated out, and makes ineffective a RULE
     foo (bar x) = ...

One could go further and make exprIsCheap reply True to any
dictionary-typed expression, but that's more work.

See Note [Dictionary-like types] in TcType.hs for why we use
isDictLikeTy here rather than isDictTy



Note [Eta expanding thunks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We don't eta-expand
   * Trivial RHSs     x = y
   * PAPs             x = map g
   * Thunks           f = case y of p -> \x -> blah

When we see
     f = case y of p -> \x -> blah
should we eta-expand it? Well, if 'x' is a one-shot state token
then 'yes' because 'f' will only be applied once.  But otherwise
we (conservatively) say no.  My main reason is to avoid expanding
PAPSs
        f = g d  ==>  f = \x. g d x
because that might in turn make g inline (if it has an inline pragma),
which we might not want.  After all, INLINE pragmas say "inline only
when saturated" so we don't want to be too gung-ho about saturating!


Note [ABot branches: use max]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider   case x of
             True  -> \x.  error "urk"
             False -> \xy. error "urk2"

Remember: ABot n means "if you apply to n args, it'll definitely diverge".
So we need (ABot 2) for the whole thing, the /max/ of the ABot arities.



Note [Combining case branches]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
  go = \x. let z = go e0
               go2 = \x. case x of
                           True  -> z
                           False -> \s(one-shot). e1
           in go2 x
We *really* want to eta-expand go and go2.
When combining the barnches of the case we have
     ATop [] `andAT` ATop [OneShotLam]
and we want to get ATop [OneShotLam].  But if the inner
lambda wasn't one-shot we don't want to do this.
(We need a proper arity analysis to justify that.)

So we combine the best of the two branches, on the (slightly dodgy)
basis that if we know one branch is one-shot, then they all must be.
-------------------------


Note [No crap in eta-expanded code]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The eta expander is careful not to introduce "crap".  In particular,
given a CoreExpr satisfying the 'CpeRhs' invariant (in CorePrep), it
returns a CoreExpr satisfying the same invariant. See Note [Eta
expansion and the CorePrep invariants] in CorePrep.

This means the eta-expander has to do a bit of on-the-fly
simplification but it's not too hard.  The alernative, of relying on
a subsequent clean-up phase of the Simplifier to de-crapify the result,
means you can't really use it in CorePrep, which is painful.



Note [Eta expansion for join points]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The no-crap rule is very tiresome to guarantee when
we have join points. Consider eta-expanding
   let j :: Int -> Int -> Bool
       j x = e
   in b

The simple way is
  \(y::Int). (let j x = e in b) y

The no-crap way is
  \(y::Int). let j' :: Int -> Bool
                 j' x = e y
             in b[j'/j] y
where I have written to stress that j's type has
changed.  Note that (of course!) we have to push the application
inside the RHS of the join as well as into the body.  AND if j
has an unfolding we have to push it into there too.  AND j might
be recursive...

So for now I'm abandonig the no-crap rule in this case. I think
that for the use in CorePrep it really doesn't matter; and if
it does, then CoreToStg.myCollectArgs will fall over.

(Moreover, I think that casts can make the no-crap rule fail too.)



Note [Eta expansion and SCCs]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that SCCs are not treated specially by etaExpand.  If we have
        etaExpand 2 (\x -> scc "foo" e)
        = (\xy -> (scc "foo" e) y)
So the costs of evaluating 'e' (not 'e y') are attributed to "foo"



Note [Eta expansion and source notes]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CorePrep puts floatable ticks outside of value applications, but not
type applications. As a result we might be trying to eta-expand an
expression like

  (src<...> v) @a

which we want to lead to code like

  \x -> src<...> v @a x

This means that we need to look through type applications and be ready
to re-add floats on the top.
